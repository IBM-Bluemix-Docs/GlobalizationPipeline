# Managing bundle translations
{: #managetranslations}


Once you have created bundles and started generating translations for your application, you can choose from machine translation and human translation. The machine generated content can be used as is or further modified. You can also choose to use a machine translation other than the default. This section describes how to change the machine translation engine that performs the translations for your bundles, how to perform human post-translation editing, how to create human translation request, and also how you can assign user roles and access restrictions to the people that will need to access to your translations.

**Note**: The human translation request is only available for professional plan users.
