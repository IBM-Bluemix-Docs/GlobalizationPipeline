# Integrating with IBM Continuous Delivery
{: #integratingdevops}


You can access {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_full}} by Delivery Pipeline in IBM Continous Delivery to rapidly translate and release cloud and mobile applications to your global customers, saving time and reducing manual translation management operations. 

IBM Continous Delivery uses {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}}'s default machine translation engine to translate your application into the languages you select,  unless you configure an alternative machine translation engine using the {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} dashboard. Besides, you can also use the {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} dashboard and RESTful API to review, update, and manage translations.
