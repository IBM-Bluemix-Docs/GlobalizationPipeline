# Importing translated resource files
{: #importetrbundles}

Alternatively, if you already have translated resource files, you can import them to a new bundle. For more information see [Java Client Tools for {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}}](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-java-tools).

**Note:**  If the original source file is updated and changes are reloaded into {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}}, the keys and values that are defined in the file are synchronized with the most recent version of the source file so that only the changed keys and values are translated.
