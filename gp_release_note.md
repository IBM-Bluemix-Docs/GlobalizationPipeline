* {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} supports RC and IAM.
* CF instance provisioning is deprecated. Existing CF instance users have three months to migrate to RC. For more information related to migration, see [Migrating {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} service instances to a resource group](/docs/GlobalizationPipeline/gp_migration.html).
* {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} provides additional API authentication/authorization options. {{site.data.keyword.GlobalizationPipeline_short}} added support for using token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) and IAM API key authentication in all the supported regions. For new service instances, you can use IAM for authentication in addition to the existing authentication mechanism provided by service.
